TODO:
Create TransferObject from Function.
Create RecursiveFunction and its TransferObject.
Create the abstract class SimpleFunction and its TransferObject.
Create SimpleFunction, from where Logarithm, Monomial, Exponential, Trigonometric inherit their methods.
Create dimension.util class FunctionToGraphic. This class transform Function objects into Graphic objects (which contais the politopo density and a List<Politopo>).

COMMENTS:
Ecuation is useless due to the fact that Function knows how to get solved itself.
